## Option 3: Story-Driven

**The Problem:** Starting a new project with Claude Code means spending hours on:
• Setting up security best practices
• Configuring CI/CD pipelines
• Creating Claude Code integration files
• Finding and documenting framework patterns
• Establishing code quality standards

**The Solution:** I built Claude AI Skill Generator to solve this once and for all.

**What it does:**
Run one command. Answer a few questions. Get a production-ready project with:

🎯 67+ specialized knowledge modules (I call them "skills")
🔐 Security patterns built in (OWASP, CVE tracking, secure credential management)
🤖 Full Claude Code integration (CLAUDE.md, slash commands, hooks)
🚀 CI/CD workflows, GitHub templates, testing frameworks
📚 Comprehensive documentation and examples

**Real-world example:**
Want to build a Nuxt 3 + FastAPI app with SQLite and authentication?

```bash
./setup-repo-multitype.sh my-app
# Answer: Full-Stack, TypeScript + Python, Database + Auth
# 2 minutes later: Complete project ready to code
```

You get:
• Nuxt 3 frontend with TypeScript & Tailwind
• FastAPI backend with async patterns
• SQLite with migration setup
• Security skills for auth implementation
• GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
• All pre-configured for Claude Code
